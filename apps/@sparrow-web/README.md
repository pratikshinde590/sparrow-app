# @sparrow/web

## Purpose

The `@sparrow/web` package is responsible for delivering the web version of the Sparrow app. It builds upon core Sparrow packages, importing functionality from `@sparrow/workspace`, `@sparrow/teams`, `@sparrow/common`, `@sparrow/library`, `@sparrow/support`, and others to create a comprehensive web-based application experience.

## Core Features

- **Web-specific Optimizations**: Tailored for performance and UI enhancements on web platforms, ensuring a smooth browser experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface, making the app accessible across different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Leverages online connectivity to sync collections, environments, and team data in real-time.

## Design Considerations

- **Cross-platform Experience**: Delivers a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices, while maintaining compatibility with the desktop app.

## Usage
After installation, you can import and start using the package within your web app setup:

```
import { initializeWebApp } from '@sparrow/web';

initializeWebApp({
  // Your app initialization configuration
});
```
